This week in class we a little mini project were we had to create to create a flag, the flag that i created was
![Flag Image](images/Germany.png)
.Probably what i had trouble in creating the Germany flags was to get the all the stripes in the flag even, but in the end i kept messing with x and y coordinates 
and i think i found it so it looks like its even.
